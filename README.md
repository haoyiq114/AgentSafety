## Papers
### 1. Web Agents

- [EIA: Environmental Injection Attack on Generalist Web Agents for Privacy Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11295)
    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Web Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: This work conducts the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in adversarial environments. It considers two adversarial targets: stealing users' specific PII or the entire user request. It proposes a novel attack method, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). EIA injects malicious content designed to adapt well to environments where the agents operate and our work instantiates EIA specifically for privacy scenarios in web environments.

- [AdvWeb: Controllable Black-box Attacks on VLM-powered Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17401)
    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Web Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: This work provides AdvWeb, a novel black-box attack framework designed against web agents. AdvWeb trains an adversarial prompter model that generates and injects adversarial prompts into web pages, misleading web agents into executing targeted adversarial actions such as inappropriate stock purchases or incorrect bank transactions, actions that could lead to severe real-world consequences. With only black-box access to the web agent, they train and optimize the adversarial prompter model using DPO, leveraging both successful and failed attack strings against the target agent.

- [Watch Out for Your Agents! Investigating Backdoor Threats to LLM-Based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11208)
    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Web Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: This work takes the first step to investigate one of the typical safety threats, backdoor attack, to LLM-based agents. They first formulate a general framework of agent backdoor attacks, then present a thorough analysis on the different forms of agent backdoor attacks. Specifically, from the perspective of the final attacking outcomes, the attacker can either choose to manipulate the final output distribution, or only introduce malicious behavior in the intermediate reasoning process, while keeping the final output correct. Extensive experiments show that LLM-based agents suffer severely from backdoor attacks, indicating an urgent need for further research on the development of defenses against backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents.

- [Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12814)
    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Web Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: In this paper, they show that multimodal agents raise new safety risks, even though attacking agents is more challenging than prior attacks due to limited access to and knowledge about the environment. Their attacks use adversarial text strings to guide gradient-based perturbation over one trigger image in the environment: (1) the captioner attack attacks white-box captioners if they are used to process images into captions as additional inputs to the VLM; (2) the CLIP attack attacks a set of CLIP models jointly, which can transfer to proprietary VLMs.

### 2. Tool Agents / RAG

- [TrustAgent: Towards Safe and Trustworthy LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01586)
    - 🔑 Key: defense
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper presents an Agent-Constitution-based agent framework, TrustAgent, with a particular focus on improving the LLM-based agent safety. The proposed framework ensures strict adherence to the Agent Constitution through three strategic components: pre-planning strategy which injects safety knowledge to the model before plan generation, in-planning strategy which enhances safety during plan generation, and post-planning strategy which ensures safety by post-planning inspection.

- [LLM Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06664)
    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: This work shows that LLM agents can autonomously hack websites, performing tasks as complex as blind database schema extraction and SQL injections without human feedback. Importantly, the agent does not need to know the vulnerability beforehand. This capability is uniquely enabled by frontier models that are highly capable of tool use and leveraging extended context. Namely, they show that GPT-4 is capable of such hacks, but existing open-source models are not. Finally, they show that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously finding vulnerabilities in websites in the wild.

    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agent, RAG
    - 📖 TLDR: This work argues that LLM-Integrated Applications blur the line between data and instructions. They reveal new attack vectors, using Indirect Prompt Injection, that enable adversaries to remotely (without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved. They derive a comprehensive taxonomy from a computer security perspective to systematically investigate impacts and vulnerabilities, including data theft, worming, information ecosystem contamination, and other novel security risks.

Malfunction Amplification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20859)
    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: This work introduces a new type of attack that causes malfunctions by misleading the agent into executing repetitive or irrelevant actions. They conduct comprehensive evaluations using various attack methods, surfaces, and properties to pinpoint areas of susceptibility. The experiments reveal that these attacks can induce failure rates exceeding 80\% in multiple scenarios. To mitigate such attacks, they propose self-examination detection methods. However, their findings indicate these attacks are difficult to detect effectively using LLMs alone, highlighting the substantial risks associated with this vulnerability.

- [Large Language Model Sentinel: LLM Agent for Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20770)
    - 🔑 Key: defense
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: In this paper, they introduce a novel defense technique named Large LAnguage MOdel Sentinel (LLAMOS), which is designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LLMs by purifying the adversarial textual examples before feeding them into the target LLM. Their method comprises two main components: a. Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b. Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that the method effectively defends against adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing adversarial robustness.

- [Frontier Models are Capable of In-context Scheming](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6593e7097565990e65c886fd/t/6751eb240ed3821a0161b45b/1733421863119/in_context_scheming_reasoning_paper.pdf)
    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: Frontier models are increasingly trained and deployed as autonomous agents, which significantly increases their potential for risks. One particular safety concern is that AI agents might covertly pursue misaligned goals, hiding their true capabilities and objectives – also known as scheming. This work studies whether models have the capability to scheme in pursuit of a goal that we provide in-context and instruct the model to strongly follow.

    - 🔑 Key: defense
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced safety challenges for LLM-powered agents due to their diverse objectives and outputs. To address this, GuardAgent is proposed as a guardrail system for monitoring other LLM agents, creating task plans from user-defined guard requests and generating executable code to ensure compliance. It requires no additional training, uses an extendable toolbox, and demonstrates strong generalization and low operational overhead. GuardAgent achieves high accuracy (98.7% and 90.0%) on two benchmarks for privacy and safety, highlighting its adaptability and effectiveness in moderating invalid inputs and outputs.

- [Unleashing Worms and Extracting Data: Escalating the Outcome of Attacks against RAG-based Inference in Scale and Severity Using Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08045)
    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agent, RAG
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper demonstrates how jailbreaking a GenAI model enables attackers to escalate the severity and scale of attacks on RAG-based GenAI-powered applications. It shows that attackers can escalate RAG membership inference and entity extraction attacks into full RAG document extraction, retrieving up to 99.8% of database content. Additionally, attackers can amplify RAG data poisoning attacks to compromise the entire GenAI ecosystem by crafting adversarial self-replicating prompts that propagate as worms, forcing affected applications to perform malicious activities. The paper evaluates the performance factors influencing these attacks and discusses guardrails to protect against RAG-based inference attacks, highlighting trade-offs.

- [RedAgent: Red Teaming Large Language Models with Context-aware Autonomous Language Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16667)
    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper addresses the safety concerns of jailbreak attacks on advanced LLMs like GPT-4, which expose vulnerabilities by inducing toxic responses through adversarial prompts. To improve red teaming methods, the authors propose RedAgent, a multi-agent LLM system that generates context-aware jailbreak prompts by modeling attacks into “jailbreak strategies” and using self-reflective learning from contextual feedback. Experiments show RedAgent efficiently jailbreaks most black-box LLMs in five queries and uncovers 60 severe vulnerabilities in real-world applications with only two queries per vulnerability. The findings have been reported to OpenAI and Meta for mitigation.

- [Mitigating the Privacy Issues in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via Pure Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14773)
    - 🔑 Key: defense
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agent, RAG
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper addresses privacy risks in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that use private data for retrieval by proposing SAGE, a two-stage synthetic data generation paradigm. SAGE preserves key contextual information in stage-1 using attribute-based extraction and generation, and enhances privacy in stage-2 through agent-based iterative refinement. Experiments show that SAGE achieves comparable performance to original data while significantly reducing privacy risks. This work pioneers the development of high-utility, privacy-preserving synthetic data for safer RAG applications across various domains.

- [PLeak: Prompt Leaking Attacks against Large Language Model Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06823)
    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agent, RAG
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper designs a novel, closed-box prompt leaking attack framework, called PLeak, to optimize an adversarial query such that when the attacker sends it to a target LLM application, its response reveals its own system prompt. They formulate finding such an adversarial query as an optimization problem and solve it with a gradient-based method approximately. The key idea is to break down the optimization goal by optimizing adversary queries for system prompts incrementally, i.e., starting from the first few tokens of each system prompt step by step until the entire length of the system prompt.

- [Optimization-based Prompt Injection Attack to LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17710)
    - 🔑 Key: attack, defense
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agent, RAG
    - 📖 TLDR: This work propose JudgeDeceiver, an optimization-based prompt injection attack to LLM-as-a-Judge. JudgeDeceiver injects a carefully crafted sequence into an attacker-controlled candidate response such that LLM-as-a-Judge selects the candidate response for an attacker-chosen question no matter what other candidate responses are. The extensive evaluation shows that JudgeDeceive is highly effective, and is much more effective than existing prompt injection attacks that manually craft the injected sequences and jailbreak attacks when extended to our problem. They also show the effectiveness of JudgeDeceiver in three case studies, i.e., LLM-powered search, RLAIF, and tool selection. Moreover, they consider defenses including known-answer detection, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection. The results show these defenses are insufficient.

    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: RAG
    - 📖 TLDR: This work proposes an attack for dense retrieval systems in which a malicious user generates a small number of adversarial passages by perturbing discrete tokens to maximize similarity with a provided set of training queries. When these adversarial passages are inserted into a large retrieval corpus, they show that this attack is highly effective in fooling these systems to retrieve them for queries that were not seen by the attacker.

    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Communicative Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: In this work, they report an even more severe safety issue in multi-agent environments, referred to as infectious jailbreak. It entails the adversary simply jailbreaking a single agent, and without any further intervention from the adversary, (almost) all agents will become infected exponentially fast and exhibit harmful behaviors.

    - 📖 TLDR: This paper elaborately conducts a series of manual jailbreak prompts along with a virtual chat-powered evil plan development team, dubbed Evil Geniuses, to thoroughly probe the safety aspects of these agents. Our investigation reveals three notable phenomena: 1. LLM-based agents exhibit reduced robustness against malicious attacks. 2. the attacked agents could provide more nuanced responses. 3. the detection of the produced improper responses is more challenging.

    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Communicative Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: This work proposes a comprehensive framework grounded in agent psychology. The framework focuses on three aspects: identifying how dark personality traits in agents might lead to risky behaviors, designing defense strategies to mitigate these risks, and evaluating the safety of multi-agent systems from both psychological and behavioral perspectives. The experiments reveal several intriguing phenomena, such as the collective dangerous behaviors among agents, agents' propensity for self-reflection when engaging in dangerous behavior, and the correlation between agents' psychological assessments and their dangerous behaviors.

### 4. OS Agents

- [Attacking Vision-Language Computer Agents via Pop-ups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02391)
    - 🔑 Key: attack
    - 🤖 Agent Type: OS Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: This work demonstrates that VLM agents can be easily attacked by a set of carefully designed adversarial pop-ups, which human users would typically recognize and ignore. This distraction leads agents to click these pop-ups instead of performing the tasks as usual. Integrating these pop-ups into existing agent testing environments like OSWorld and VisualWebArena leads to an attack success rate (the frequency of the agent clicking the pop-ups) of 86% on average and decreases the task success rate by 47%.

- [AgentHarm: A Benchmark for Measuring Harmfulness of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09024)
    - 🔑 Key: benchmark
    - 🤖 Agent Type: Tool Agent
    - 📖 TLDR: This work proposes a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. They evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. They publicly release AgentHarm to enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents.
